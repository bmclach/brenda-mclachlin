    <p>Each student is unique, so I tailor each lesson to their past experiences and their level of openess.</p>
    
    <p>This lesson plan is for the first lesson I would have with a student. The main goal of this lesson is to break the ice and get them excited about learning music. </p>
      
      <p> Naturally future lessons would have more to do with practicing techniques, but those are a lot more boring.</p>
